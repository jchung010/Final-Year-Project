# Final-Year-Project

This repository contains the arduino code and matlab simulink models that I used for my final year project to create the Smart Indoor Management System (SIMS). 

You can find the arduino code in .ino format inside the folder motionsensor_telegram_esp32

You can find the matlab simulink models in .slx format inside the folder matlab_simulink. Within these files, the matlab code to implement the perturb & observe algorithm can be retrieved
